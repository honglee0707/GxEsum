Interpreting column names as follows:
snpid:	Variant ID (e.g., rs number)
N:	Sample size
a1:	Allele 1, interpreted as ref allele for signed sumstat.
pval:	p-Value
beta:	[linear/logistic] regression coefficient (0 --> no effect; above 0 --> A1 is trait/risk increasing)
a2:	Allele 2, interpreted as non-ref allele for signed sumstat.

Reading list of SNPs for allele merge from w_hm3.snplist
Read 1217311 SNPs for allele merge.
Reading sumstats from example.ldsc into memory 5000000 SNPs at a time.

Read 5000 SNPs from --sumstats file.
Removed 0 SNPs not in --merge-alleles.
Removed 34 SNPs with missing values.
Removed 0 SNPs with INFO <= 0.9.
Removed 0 SNPs with MAF <= 0.01.
Removed 0 SNPs with out-of-bounds p-values.
Removed 0 variants that were not SNPs or were strand-ambiguous.
4966 SNPs remain.
Removed 0 SNPs with duplicated rs numbers (4966 SNPs remain).
Removed 0 SNPs with N < 66.6666666667 (4966 SNPs remain).
Median value of beta was -0.001688, which seems sensible.
Removed 0 SNPs whose alleles did not match --merge-alleles (4966 SNPs remain).
